              " 'Updated December 15th My previous 4 star review from September 28th is below and in terms of the sound quality the review is still accurate I ended up having some problems with the soundbar system a couple of weeks later though and that has led me to take 1 star back The subwoofer stopped working and without the subwoofer this sound system is terrible tinny no depth nothing you would ever want to listen to I contacted a customer service rep and he had me verify that the power supply was not the problem and then he had me return the subwoofer for replacement Or so I thought It turned out they were going to repair it It took a couple of weeks and when they returned it all they had done was replace the power supply that we already knew was working just fine I couldn t ascertain whether they had even tested the subwoofer to see if it would function After a few more emails they finally broke down and sent me a new system soundbar and subwoofer Everything was working fine until I tried to play something through one of the video apps on my SmartTV All I got was very loud and annoying static My customer service rep said he would do some research to find out if there was something peculiar about the specific video apps that we could fix somehow In the meantime I looked through the users guide and found a note about a setting on my TV that should alleviate the static It wasn t easy to figure out how to change to this setting but I did find it and it did work So now everything is working fine and I m back to being reasonably happy with this system But the ineptness of their repair team and the time it took to rectify the problem now make this a 3 star product in my opinion Original review from Sept 28th Bigger isn t always better but in this case it s a step in the right direction I m not a major audiophile and I don t require big chest rattling sound from my home entertainment system but I admit to liking this soundbar a lot It is not the highest quality sound but it s very good It does not compare to my stereo speakers but it does provide a nice big sound that makes you feel like you re at the movie theater Setup was a breeze with one exception see below and I found that I only had to consult the directions a couple of times I used the digital optical input and for my TV I had to change the audio configuration to be external speaker only The downside is that when I don t want to use the soundbar I have to reconfigure the TV settings A minor point it just means I probably will only use the soundbar for long programs and movies The first couple of days that I had the soundbar in place I watched a baseball game and a movie and felt the soundbar really enhanced the experience There are a few different sound schemes TV music small hall large hall etc and it s easy to pick and choose which one works best for you I seem to like small hall for the most part My cable provider offers music streaming so I listened to a couple of those stations too and the soundbar really enhances that sound I could hook my stereo system up to this too but I think I like my regular stereo speakers better for listening to my own music library The subwoofer is wirelessly connected to the soundbar to enable flexibility in placement You can easily adjust how much oomph you want from the subwoofer through a button on the remote control It does add a nice amount of depth to the sound Pairing the subwoofer to the soundbar was automatic and effortless Now here s my one complaint Pinnacle does not have telephone customer support so when my soundbar didn t come on when I initially set it up there was no way for me to get help Pinnacle s website provides and email address so I did send a note to them In the meantime I unplugged the system and then plugged it back in and it started working just fine The customer support person did email me back the next day so I now have a contact number if I have further problems I think this system is probably excellent for this price category referring to the steeply discounted price offered at the time I received it but I think there are other sound systems in the higher priced categories that will give you better quality sound That s not to say I m not happy with this system I like it a lot and I know I will make good use of it',\n",

              " 'Samsung s UN55C8000 LED TV LED backlit LCD represents a good first step in full HD 3D technology but it s definitely not without its flaws Drawbacks High price Problems handling 24 frame second material movies Mixed results with upconversion of standard def material to HD Some crosstalk on native and upconverted 3D content Some lighting uniformity issues compared to best plasma and local dimming sets Pros Nice black levels and shadow detail for a super thin under 1 inch edge lit LED set Bright accurate colors Energy efficient Excellent 3D effect with native 3D content Decent 3D upconversion of 2D content varies based on content Extremely robust selection of IPTV content web based widgets audio and video streaming As for price yes this is one of the first full HD 3D TVs on the market so you can expect to pay a premium but 3500 list is a lot to pay for a 55 inch TV Panasonic s comparably sized and featured 54 inch 3D VT25 plasma lists for 500 less Even Samsung s own 3D capable 46 inch LCD set standard CCFL backlighting theLN46C750sells for about half the price of this LED lit model At 1799 list the 46 inch 3D LCD is only slightly more expensive than comparably sized comparably featured 2D models For SD upconversion the C8000 does well with the standard jaggies tests and 2 3 cadence detection in its Auto 1 mode but it falls apart with mixed content video titles on a film background creating combing tearing artifacts on the screen unless you go out of your way to change the mode setting to Auto 2 mode A good video processor should be able to accomodate both types of content without the user having to go deep into the set up menus The C8000 s 3D feature is both a pro and a con On native 3D content such as the Monster Vs Aliens on Blu ray 3D as well as some test patterns we had on a USB stick the set s illusion of depth and dimensionality is impressive as good if not better than the 3D effect seen in most theaters And we found that it maintained the 3D effect even from 25 feet away and from well off axis watching TV from the side of the room instead of directly in front of it Yes there are times when you can get some crosstalk left eye image visible by the right eye which leads to ghosting but this is fairly sporadic and generally isn t so obtrusive as to minimize one s enjoyment of the movie Samsung added a setting in the 1016 0 firmware that allows you to adjust the 3D mode to minimize crosstalk and this does help though even with the feature enabled there can still be some crosstalk at times Also Samsung offers a real time 2D to 3D conversion feature which is more effective than we expected and can give you some additional depth and 3D qualities on existing content It s particularly effective on vector based animation and games but even on theatrical titles such as Star Trek and Avatar on 2D Blu ray Disc certain scenes do take on a pleasant though mild sense of depth Back in 2D mode we did notice one unexpected issue with the C8000 s handling of 24p content 24 frames second from standard Blu ray Discs Previous Samsung models had the ability to apply motion interpolation Samsung s Auto Motion Plus feature for video based content independently from film content The separate settings for Judder Reduction film and Blur Reduction video worked independently This allows the user to apply motion interpolation to video sources like live sports and concert videos minimizing screen blur and smooting out the motion while still presenting movies in a native 24p mode that preserves that filmic feel that many movie lovers prefer In the C8000 model even with Judder Reduction OFF set to 0 in Custom mode there is still some motion interpolation going on which causes movies to look a little more like video called by some the soap opera effect Hopefully this is a problem that can be fixed via firmware but as of the time of this review that is not yet available update this issue has been confirmed by Samsung QA and engineering As an edge lit set there are also some issues with picture uniformity When you re lighting up an entire set with just a string of LED lights along the edges there s only so far that a diffusor panel can go to get a nice uniform backlight Samsung has improved this over last year s edge lit models through the use of a technique called Precision Dimming With Precision Dimming areas of the lighting assembly can be turned off or dimmed independently of other areas So instead of having one big bright backlight with only the LCD shutters to provide darkness the TV can selectively dim parts of the screen like the top and bottom letterbox areas of 2 35 1 and 2 4 1 movies This leads to less hot spotting around the edges and better overall black levels It s not quite as effective as full local dimming with a full array LED backlight but it s better than having no local dimming technology Combined with the 2010 improvements in the LCD panel itself the uniformity and black level performance of the new sets is getting closer to a plasma or full array LED LCD set with local dimming Next year they ll probably get even better Color reproduction of the C8000 is excellent with saturation near the performance of the best plasmas and this color and grey scale accuracy holds up even in the dimmer 3D mode so no real complaints there but the colors don t quite pop as much as they do on local dimming LED and plasma sets as the level of the blacks is not quite as deep as those other technologies In terms of the internet streaming and IPTV content again no complaints here with VUDU Blockbuster VOD Netflix streaming Pandora internet radio and Yahoo widgets etc as well as DLNA compatibility the C8000 TV brings a wealth of content to your TV from your home network and from the internet at large One might imagine that over time these services will also be helpful in providing native 3D content which for now is extremely hard to come by Overall there is a lot to like about the C8000 but it does suffer from a few first generation issues If the high price and relatively minor issues with 2D upconversion and occasional 3D crosstalk don t worry you too much then it s definitely worth a look But there s also something to be said for waiting to see what they come up with next year when more content is available and some of these early issues have been worked out It s also possible that some of these issues may be improved with firmware updates so early adopters may still benefit from enhancements as time goes on Our complete review of the UN55C8000 is available

              " 'I recently had to replace a Targus bag that I had used for almost 12 years I am able to put my DELL E6400 in with all its accessories This bag offers LOTS of room I particularly like the deep pocket that is located just in front of the Laptop pocket Lots of room here for a Power cable wireless mouse and other bits that you may need to get at in a hurry I use this pocket to dump all my items that I m carrying just prior to going through a medal detector or airport security The small side pockets are perfect for patch cables or small cell phone chargers and overall the bag seems make of good materials However there are several issue I found that make this not quite the perfect bag First off there is a severe lack of padding around the outside and bottom edges of the laptop pocket I remedied this by removing the plastic covered 1 inch pad that was Velcro ed to the inside of the laptop pocket in my Targus bag It fit perfectly into the pocket on this bag which leaves me to wonder why there isn t one there after all this is a laptop bag Another issue is there is no rubber feet on the bottom of the bag to protect the bottom or to raise it up off of dirty wet floors or sidewalks when you set it down The bottom of the bag is covered with a plastic impregnated fabric but I would think that it will not hold up for as long as my other bag did There is also a stiff flap on the bottom of the middle pocket that is supposed to hold the bag bottom in shape and make it flat This however tends to fold up and will not allow the bag to sit on its bottom in an upright position Also if you put something small like a pen or adapter into the middle pocket it will eventually end up under this stiff pad making hard to find and causing a bump on the bottom of the bag that will accelerate wear There is a cell phone web pouch in the left shoulder strap It is located on the bottom of the strap rather then up near the top and i don t know what cell phones the designers of this bag use but forget about putting anything bigger then a simple flip phone in this pouch While on the subject of straps the adjustment straps at the bottom of the shoulder strap are quite long meaning if you have them cinched up while wearing it or leave them cinched up so you can throw the bag over one shoulder like I do the straps are left dangling I solved this problem by purchasing a couple of back pack strap organizers from my local camping store These have plastic clips that go over the part of the strap that goes from the bag to the bottom of the shoulder strap and offer a small fabric covered bungee that lets you secure the lose part of the strap in loops It would be nice if there was some sort of pocket on the strap to put the lose ends into to hold them out of the way My old bag had theseThere is also a small rubber portal to pass a headphone cable through However the portal is in the LARGE middle pocket rather then the smaller top pocket or the side pocket just below it There is a metal grommet just inside the larger pocket that allows you to pass the cable into the smaller top pocket This means that every time to put the cable in or take it out of the bag you have to go this process of weaving the cable through the bag Also if you accidentally tug on the cable you will probably break it rather then simply pulling it out of the player A couple last thing I know a lot of bags are used by business people so why isn t there a nice easy to access pocket to put business cards in There is a pouch in the top pocket and some slot like pockets in the front for credit cards but nothing where you can put a small stack of cards within easy reach A few pen holders in the front pocket would be nice as well These are more of wish list items rather then a design flawsOver all I like the bag but I don t love it since my original 12 year old bag finally started to show its age this will be an adequate replacement until I see something better Since laptops and tablets have been around for a very long time you would think that there would be some more real world design that goes into them especially at the prices being charged for them',\n",

              " 'This would be the second Sony wireless home theater speaker system I ve owned and I am quite impressed with the improvements This product upgrades what I already thought an impressive system There are improvements all around and very little not to like From the flawless wireless tech and the crystal clear sound quality to the near all in one capabilities I quickly realized that this is a very dominating system The product is easy enough to setup but I did find that the default configuration needed some tweaking However I was quite impressed with the amount of options that were available The reason for that might be because the product allows you to connect to a virtual Home input This is basically just a dashboard that allows you to configure the product use apps and select inputs It resembles the PS3 XMB interface if you are familiar Every receiver I ve ever used forces you to wrestle with the front LCD for configuration so the dashboard is either a new paradigm for all receivers or Sony is cleverly innovating here Of course the downside of having to go through the dashboard is that you need to switch your TV to the BluRay input in order to even get to it Settings like enabling DTS are not possible to configure from the front LCD which some may find inconvenient for on the fly changes In fact I found that without enabling Dolby or DTS I was not even able to get 5 1 surround sound from my TV using optical audio no matter what Sound Mode was selected on the receiver using the front LCD After I located the proper settings in the dashboard I m now emulating DTS across the board and it sounds spectacular Maybe it s just that I can now emulate DTS instead of just Dolby Pro Logic like I m used to but the sound clarity on this system blows my previous Sony system out of the water I now hear things in movies and TV shows that I never knew were there I ve even gotten comments from multiple people telling me how eerie the clarity is I don t consider myself an audiophile but I would definitely put this sound system up there with some of the best I ve ever heard Take that for what it s worth Another great option that I ve seen on other Sony receivers is the ability to automatically configure individual speaker volumes using a provided microphone You place the microphone at a certain point in the room and the system is able to adjust individual speaker volume for optimal surround sound You can also adjust volumes manually so you can do things like boost the center channel if you get annoyed like me about voice audio being so much lower than sound effects in movies The system also supports apps DLNA and other internet functionality I wasn t impressed with the app selection but I do like that I can connect to my Plex server without having to use a separate device like a Roku Unfortunately the interface for accessing DLNA content doesn t support resume so it doesn t make much of a replacement I do give them points for supporting it though I don t find this product has too many faults beyond what I already mentioned The glossy black finish does draw quite a bit of dust And while the front speakers come with a tall stand the rear satellite speakers do not This sort of nullifies some of the usefulness of the wireless If you have a couch in the middle of the room wireless rear speakers is pretty much your only option But if you can t prop the speakers on a stand behind your couch what are you supposed to do with them I don t deduct any points for this though because I didn t personally run into this issue but it is worth mentioning Overall this is a great product that I am glad to own and have no problems recommending highly UPDATE This product does not support Dolby Digital Plus which you would need in order to get proper surround sound out of the Netflix app on the Roku Some people might find that annoying me being one of them Others would probably just use the Netflix app on the Sony itself I did some reading and found that the regular Dolby Digital signal is embedded inside a DD signal There may be licenses required in order to do that I don t know But it could also be a flaw with this product If I pass the audio through my TV it works fine probably because the TV is converting it into a DD signal without any issue I would probably use the Netflix app on the Sony itself if the thing was able to actually get an internet connection I m pretty sure an update I downloaded broke the internet connectivity on the device No matter what I do no matter if every other device on the network has a connection no matter wired or wireless the Sony fails to do so It gets an IP fine and can detect my Plex server but no internet Very frustrating I knocked this review down 1 star UPDATE 2 The system is not without its problems I have encountered a number of very annoying issues As mentioned the system does not seem to support Dolby Digital Plus over HDMI It actually does support DD but only via BluRay or by playing a video file through USB So it s not Roku friendly The internet connection issues persist Despite the fact that every other device on my network has no trouble getting an internet connection no matter what I do the Sony receiver fails to connect to the internet tried different cables using wifi connecting directly to the modem factory resetting etc This means checking for firmware updates requires me to download the files to a USB drive and update the system manually Sony is slow to push out firmware updates Another major issue is that one of the satellite speakers has started to vibrate rather unnaturally I called Sony to get a replacement but they want me to pay to ship the entire unit and charge me 100 to inspect it over a 2 week period where they may or may not repair it I purchased better satellite speakers instead for 100 I can t be certain if it was my kids that damaged the speaker it has no physical signs of damage but the new speakers are protected from little fingers anyway and sound better There are also other issues with the software Sometimes the unit will hang while shutting down or starting up It just sits there and blinks perpetually I have to physically unplug it to get it to reboot Other times the video will simply black out Powering the unit off only puts it into sleep mode so it has to be unplugged to get it to reboot Whenever those video blackout moments occur I have to unplug it I knocked my review down 1 more star',\n",

              " 'As a lover of classical music and jazz who travels a lot I wanted a pair of high quality headphones that would not break the bank Sure one can find audiophile headphones with fantastic specs that sell for thousands but I could only manage a few hundred The AKG K 701 is one of the most highly rated headphones in that price range so I bought a pair I am extremely happy with the sound quality The first time I listened to something through these headphones namely Collin Walcott s albumCloud Dance I was gobsmacked by the subtle sound of fingers moving over strings a detail that I had never before heard in headphones While that might not be a specifically musical pleasure the capability to offer that level of detail does endow the music you hear with more life more richness more body and other effusive adjectives The complain I have with the headphones is not the sound quality per se but the construction These are extremely bulky headphones more than I could guess from the photo of the product here and they take up a huge amount of space in one s luggage They are also of a very open design doing nothing to block out ambient noise Now I didn t intend to walk down the street with these but even within the privacy of a hotel room if there is a trafficked street nearby or even loud crickets even that amount of noise will shatter your ability to appreciate the music Thus the AKG K 701 is a flawed product for what I would imagine are a significant portion of headphone buyers those who want to want to hear music away from their home where they presumably own a decent stereo system with speakers Consequently the only demographic that will be entirely satisifed with these headphones are those who live in a block of flats which must necessarily be a very quiet one and don t want to disturb neighbours who would protest at the noise made by a speaker setup',\n",
